title: "GI Shiny python"
---

This is a minimal demonstration of using Shinylive python.


Try changing this code and running it using the little arrow top right of the editor window. Perhaps something like printing "Hello lovely _NAME_" instead or moving the greeting before the input textbox?

Point to note is that this minimal 'hello world' example is a fully interactive online application. It's that easy.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
## file: app.py
from shiny.express import ui, render, input

ui.input_text("name", "Type a name", value="world")

@render.text
def greeting():
  return f"Hello {input.name()}!"
```
